## Good vs. Bad Implementation Practices

### ✔ Good Practices:

- Use the designated tech stack: FastAPI (Python) for the backend API and Phaser 3 (TypeScript) for the client game engine.
- Leverage Groq API for all LLM calls (story/scene generation) instead of hard-coded scripts.
- Utilize AI image generation (e.g., DALL·E or Stable Diffusion API) for sprites/backgrounds with consistent style (8-color palette, 2px outline).
- Keep code modular and readable: separate concerns (e.g. dedicated modules for LLM integration, image generation, RL logic).
- Follow caching best practices for expensive calls (LLM or image generation) – e.g., cache outputs to avoid duplicate requests when the same prompt is used.
- Write tests for new features (PyTest for backend, Jest/Cypress for frontend) to ensure reliability.

### ❌ Bad Practices (Avoid):

- **Hardcoding Content:** Do not hard-code story text, dialogues, or images. All narrative and visuals must be generated by the AI pipeline (per project goals).
- Using unauthorized libraries or frameworks – stick to the chosen stack (no introducing a different game engine or web framework).
- Ignoring output validation: for example, don't assume the LLM's JSON is always correct – always validate and handle errors.
- Global state misuse: avoid using global variables for game state that can lead to inconsistent behavior; instead, pass state through proper scene management or context.
- Large, monolithic functions – break down logic into smaller functions or methods for clarity and reuse.
- Neglecting performance optimizations: e.g., generating very large images or making blocking API calls on the main thread without feedback. Always aim for smooth user experience (target 60 FPS gameplay, <2s initial load).
- Leaving AI outputs unchecked – ensure the content respects guidelines (e.g., PG-10 language, no disallowed content as per prompt guardrails).

## Chat Response Guidelines

The AI assistant (Cursor agent) should communicate in a clear, step-by-step manner. When responding to prompts or tasks, it should first confirm understanding, then outline a solution approach before writing code.

- Answer concisely and informatively: provide just enough explanation for clarity, then focus on delivering the solution (code or task completion). If the user asks for explanation, give it in simple terms.
- **Markdown formatting:** Use proper Markdown in responses for readability. For code blocks, use triple backticks and specify the language (e.g., `typescript` or `python`) for syntax highlighting.
- When listing steps or considerations, use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.
- **Chain-of-thought:** It's acceptable (even encouraged) for the agent to briefly reason through a problem before coding (in the chat), but this reasoning should be concise. The agent might say, "I will do X, then Y, to achieve Z." This helps ensure sequential thinking and correctness.
- **Final answers:** When the task is to produce code, the final response should primarily be the code solution (or the diff/changes) after the reasoning. The agent should not include extraneous commentary beyond what's necessary to understand the change.
- **Error handling in conversation:** If the agent encounters errors or unknowns, it should not guess blindly. Instead, it should state the issue and, if possible, use tools (like debugging via MCP) or ask for clarification. For example, "I see an error in the console regarding X; I'll investigate that before proceeding." This keeps the interaction focused and transparent.

## Coding Style Guidelines

### Python (Backend):

Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for naming and formatting. Use `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for class names, and 4-space indentation. Include type hints for function signatures and dataclasses/Pydantic models for clarity. Write docstrings for modules, classes, and complex functions to explain their purpose. Handle exceptions gracefully (use try/except around external API calls, with logging as needed).

### TypeScript (Frontend):

Adhere to a consistent style (align with typical ESLint/Prettier rules or project conventions). Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, and `PascalCase` for classes and interfaces. Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`. Leverage type definitions and interfaces for complex structures (e.g., define an interface for the SceneDSL JSON structure to ensure type-checking of LLM output on the client side). Keep functions small and focused; for example, `renderScene()` in DynamicScene should delegate specifics (dialogue rendering, sprite setup) to helper methods or utilities rather than doing everything inline.

### Comments & Documentation:

Write comments where non-obvious decisions or algorithms are used (e.g., tricky math in the mini-game, or a workaround due to an API limitation). Keep comments up-to-date if code changes. Remove any leftover commented-out code or temporary prints when finalizing a task.

### Project Structure Conventions:

Follow the structure given by the project – for instance, keep scene-specific logic in the corresponding scene classes (do not put gameplay logic in the main index or unrelated files). Use the provided utility modules (like `dialogUI.ts` for dialogue display, `assetLoader.ts` for loading assets) rather than creating duplicate functionality. This ensures consistency and easier maintenance.

### Naming:

Use descriptive names that make the code self-explanatory. For example, prefer `generateSceneDSL(prompt: str)` over `handlePrompt()`, or `avatarSprite` over `img1`. This will make the AI-generated content easier to integrate and debug. Avoid single-letter variable names except for loop indices or very short scopes.

### Libraries and Framework Usage:

Use the right library function for the job and avoid re-inventing the wheel. For instance, use Phaser's built-in tweens for transitions (instead of manually timing loops), use TensorFlow.js APIs for loading and running the model rather than writing low-level math, and use FastAPI features (like dependency injection or middleware) for clean code rather than hacking around them. Also, maintain consistency in API usage (e.g., if using axios or Fetch on front-end, stick to one approach throughout).

### Testing Style:

When writing tests, name test functions clearly (e.g., `test_generate_game_valid_input()` in Python or `should_transitionToClimaxOnChoiceB()` in a front-end test). Tests should be deterministic and cover both typical and edge cases (like what if the LLM returns an error or empty content). This ensures changes can be validated quickly.

## Dependency Management & Consistency

### Library Dependencies:

When adding a new library or API, update the appropriate files: for Python, add to `requirements.txt`; for Node/TS, add to `package.json`. After installing, run the build/test to ensure nothing breaks. Keep dependency versions consistent (pin versions if needed to avoid future incompatibility). Avoid adding heavy dependencies unless necessary – prefer lightweight solutions or existing project tools.

### Cross-Module Changes:

If you change a data model or contract, propagate those changes everywhere. For example, if the SceneDSL JSON schema changes (say you add a new field or rename one), update the Pydantic schema in `backend/schemas/`, the TypeScript interface in the client (if one exists for the DSL), and any logic that reads those fields (e.g., in `DynamicScene.ts`). This prevents runtime mismatches between backend output and frontend usage.

### Function and API Updates:

When modifying a function signature or behavior (e.g. changing the parameters of `generateGame` or the output format), find all call sites (the Cursor IDE can help with global find) and update them. This includes adjusting unit tests, other functions, or even documentation. Never assume a changed function is only used in one place. Keep the API between front and back in sync: the front-end should expect whatever the back-end sends.

### Resource and Asset Management:

If adding new asset files (images, templates, models), ensure the code that loads assets knows about them. For instance, if a new sprite image is generated, add its path to the loading list or dynamic loader. If you remove or rename assets, search and update references in code (Phaser scene preload, CSS, HTML, etc.) to avoid broken links.

### Configuration & Environment:

Manage configuration in a centralized way. If an API key or URL is required (for Groq or image API), use environment variables and document them. After changing config or adding new env vars, update setup docs (and possibly `.env.example` files) so that all environments (dev/staging/prod) remain consistent.

### Post-Change Testing:

After any significant change (dependency upgrade, new feature), run the full test suite and also manually test the integrated flow. For example, after integrating the Groq call, run the game: enter a prompt in the Home scene, and verify the game progresses through scenes without errors. Consistency means not just code updates, but ensuring the whole system still works together after each change.

## Agent Workflow & Debugging (MCP Usage)

### Sequential Task Execution:

The agent should break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks and handle them one at a time (sequential thinking). Before coding, it can outline steps (e.g., "First, integrate the API call, then handle the response, then update the frontend..."). This ensures a clear game plan and reduces mistakes.

### Leverage MCPs for Automation:

Cursor's Multi-Command Plugins (MCPs) allow the AI to automate development and debugging tasks. Always use these tools to streamline the workflow rather than doing everything manually:

- After writing code, use Browser Tools MCP for debugging the frontend. This MCP can capture browser console logs, network requests, and even take screenshots for the AI. For example, once the game runs, the agent can issue a command to fetch console errors or UI issues via the MCP (instead of expecting the human to check DevTools).
- If a UI element isn't displaying correctly or a Phaser scene fails to transition, the agent can use Browser Tools MCP to inspect the DOM or canvas and suggest layout fixes. This helps catch issues like incorrect asset paths or CSS problems immediately.
- Use Debugger Mode of Browser Tools MCP to run audits (accessibility, performance, SEO if relevant) or simply to gather all console output in one go. The agent should treat MCP output as feedback: e.g., if MCP reports a JavaScript error, the agent should address it in the next step.

### Autonomous Fixes:

In Agent mode, Cursor can run up to 25 tool calls autonomously. The agent should take initiative to run the app and debug without needing explicit user prompts for each issue. For instance, after implementing a feature, it can automatically run the project, observe the MCP logs, and then fix any errors found. This yields a tighter development loop.

### Quality Assurance via MCP:

Before marking a task as complete, the agent should effectively say, "Let's double-check with the browser logs and ensure everything is smooth." This means always reviewing MCP feedback (console is clear, no 404 asset loads, performance is within limits) before concluding. If the MCP indicates any problem, address it as part of the task.

### Referencing MCP in Documentation:

In this tasks document or future `.md` files, it's useful to note where MCP should be used. For example, when testing the game, a note like "Use BrowserToolsMCP to verify no errors in the browser console and that all assets load correctly" can be included. This reminds both developers and the AI to incorporate the MCP into the testing routine. Essentially, make MCP usage a standard part of the "Done Definition" for tasks (a task isn't done until MCP-assisted checks pass).

## Incomplete Tasks

### [ ] Initial CI/CD integration – DevOps

Configure automated quality checks, linting, formatting, and testing across the codebase using GitHub Actions.

**Description:** Set up comprehensive continuous integration pipeline with code quality checks and automated testing.

**Key Steps:**

1. Install and configure Black/Flake8 for Python and ESLint/Prettier for TypeScript.

2. Add lint and format scripts to `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml` and `package.json`.

3. Set up PyTest for backend unit tests and Jest for client tests.

4. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run lint, tests, and Docker builds on each push.

**Dependencies/Changes:**
- Add lint/test dependencies to `requirements.txt` and `package.json`
- Create config files: `.flake8`, `.eslintrc.js`, `jest.config.js`

**Affected Files:**
```
pyproject.toml
.flake8
.eslintrc.js
package.json
jest.config.js
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

**Validation:**
- On push, CI pipeline passes linting and tests
- Locally, `pytest` and `npm test` complete without errors
- Docker images build successfully

### [ ] Reinforcement Learning (RL) Enemy AI Integration – Front End

Incorporate the pre-trained RL model for enemy behavior in the mini-game to ensure AI-driven gameplay dynamics.

**Description:** Use the exported TensorFlow.js model (from `public/tfjs_model/`) to control the enemy or obstacle behavior in the mini-game (`ObstacleRunScene`). This means instead of static or random obstacle movement, the model will predict actions, making the challenge adaptive.

**Key Steps:**

1. Load the TFJS model in the game. In `ObstacleRunScene.ts` (or a dedicated `RLAgent.ts` utility), use TensorFlow.js to load the model files. For example:
   ```typescript
   import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
   // ... inside scene initialization:
   const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('assets/tfjs_model/model.json');
   ```
   Ensure this path is correct and the model files are hosted (likely in `public/tfjs_model/`). This might need the model files to be copied to the build output; since `public/` is served, this should be fine.

2. Determine the state representation and action usage. Based on how the model was trained (likely using Stable-Baselines3 PPO, then converted), there should be a specific input shape (state vector) and output (action probabilities). Implement a method to collect the game state at each decision step – e.g., the player's position, velocity, positions of upcoming obstacles – and feed it into the model to get an action. You may need to mirror the preprocessing used during training. If the training environment is known (perhaps a simplified environment), try to emulate that in how you construct the state.

3. On each game tick or at certain intervals, call the model to decide enemy behavior. For example, if the enemy is some creature chasing the player, the model might decide to jump or attack at certain times. In an obstacle run, the "enemy" could be the pattern of obstacles – the model could decide when to spawn an obstacle or how it moves. Integrate this such that it doesn't slow down the game: perhaps limit model inference to, say, 5 times per second, not every frame (depending on performance). Use `tf.tidy()` to avoid memory leaks if creating tensors each time.

4. Provide a fallback or adjust difficulty: If the model is not loaded (or takes too long), have a default behavior (maybe a simple heuristic or repeating pattern) so the game remains functional. Likewise, if the model's actions are too hard or too easy, consider scaling difficulty (this could be future fine-tuning rather than now).

5. Confirm that the addition of the model doesn't tank performance. On desktop it should be fine, but check frame rates. If needed, offload the model prediction to a web worker or async function so as not to block the main thread. Phaser could pause while computing, so better to do small computations or use `setTimeout` / `requestAnimationFrame` to spread out the work.

**Affected Files:**
- `client/src/scenes/ObstacleRunScene.ts`: major changes here to integrate the RL model. Add model loading in preload or create (ensuring to await or use a promise for tfjs). Use the model in the game loop (`update()` method) to drive obstacle movements or enemy decisions.
- `client/public/tfjs_model/`: ensure it contains `model.json` and weight files (`.bin`). These might have been exported; double-check their paths. If needed, adjust the path in code to match.
- `client/package.json`: include `@tensorflow/tfjs` as a dependency (if not already). This can be large (~ tens of MB), but since this is a game with heavy AI focus, it's expected.

**Dependencies/Changes:** The model files need to be accessible; if they're large, we might consider lazy-loading them (only load when needed, e.g., when starting the mini-game scene). Also consider version compatibility: ensure the tfjs version matches the model's training version (if known). No backend changes expected, as this is purely client-side inference.

**Validation:** Run the mini-game and observe enemy behavior. Ideally, see that the enemies/obstacles are reacting or moving in a way that isn't just random or static, indicating the model is controlling them. Use Browser Tools MCP to watch for any errors (e.g., tfjs failing to load, or shape mismatches causing exceptions). If errors occur, adjust the state inputs or model usage accordingly. Additionally, monitor performance: use the performance tab or FPS counter to ensure it stays ~60 FPS. If the FPS drops significantly during model usage, consider optimizations (like reducing model calls or simplifying the model). The game should remain responsive and fun.

### [ ] Testing & Quality Assurance

Ensure the new AI-driven features work correctly and meet performance targets through automated tests and final checks.

**Description:** Create and run tests to verify that all parts of the feature work as expected, and perform final QA using both automated tools and manual testing (including using MCP for runtime monitoring).

**Key Steps:**

1. **Backend Unit Tests:** Write tests for the story generation endpoint. In `backend/app/tests/`, add a test case for `/generateGame`: you might monkeypatch the Groq API call to return a known JSON (to avoid calling external API in tests) and then assert that the endpoint responds with a 200 status and the expected JSON structure. Also test validation: e.g., if the user prompt is empty or contains disallowed content (maybe the system prompt should handle that, but you could simulate the LLM returning `{"error": "seed_not_allowed"}` and ensure the backend passes it through or handles it).

2. **Front-end Unit/Integration Tests:** Using Jest (and possibly jsdom), test the DynamicScene logic in isolation. This could be tricky due to Phaser reliance, but you can refactor parts of the logic (like the JSON parsing functions) into testable pure functions. For example, a function that takes a dialogue scene JSON and returns an array of choice strings – test that it correctly extracts `choice_a` and `choice_b`. If using React-like structures for UI (maybe not, since it's Phaser), you could unit test those utilities (`dialogUI`, `assetLoader`).

3. **End-to-End Test:** Utilize Cypress or another browser automation to simulate a full game run. For instance, spin up the dev server, then have Cypress open the page, input a sample prompt ("A brave knight..."), click Play, then wait for the game to generate. Once the game is running, programmatically choose one of the dialogue options, then ensure a mini-game canvas appears, then end the game and check that an ending text is shown. This E2E test would cover the integration of backend and frontend. (If setting up Cypress is too time-consuming, at least perform this scenario manually and note the results.)

4. **Performance Check:** Use Lighthouse or similar (possibly via Browser Tools MCP audit) to ensure load time and performance meet targets. Specifically, check that the initial load (after clicking Play) is reasonably fast (some delay is expected for generation, but it should not be unbearably long; if it is, consider adding a loading bar). Check memory usage as well; ensure no large memory leaks or buildup (especially with tfjs or multiple images).

5. **PG-10 Content Check:** Although the LLM prompt includes guardrails, do a final content review. For a given prompt, look at the output JSON (especially dialogues) to ensure no profanity or disallowed content slipped through. This can be a manual check or an automated scan for certain words. It's part of quality to make sure the game stays family-friendly as intended.

**Affected Files:** New test files like `backend/app/tests/test_game_generation.py`, possibly `client/src/__tests__/dynamicScene.test.ts`, etc. Also might create a basic `cypress/integration/playthrough.cy.js` if doing E2E. No production code changes here, but tests might reveal bugs that require going back to fix in the above tasks' files.

**Validation:** All unit tests and integration tests should pass. The CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) should show green. Manually, run through a couple of story generations to ensure the system is stable. Use MCP's Audit Mode (if available) to run a suite of audits (performance, best practices) – address any high-severity issues that come up (for example, large bundle sizes, or accessibility issues like missing alt text if applicable). At this point, the feature should be robust and ready for deployment.

### [ ] Documentation & Cleanup

Finalize documentation and clean up any loose ends or placeholders.

**Description:** Update project documentation to reflect the new AI-generation features, and remove any placeholder code or artifacts that were used during development but are no longer needed. This ensures maintainability and clarity for future contributors (or for ourselves in later phases).

**Key Steps:**

1. **README Updates:** Expand the `README.md` to include instructions for using the AI LoreCrafter. For example, how to run the backend and frontend, the need for a Groq API key, and perhaps sample prompts that yield interesting results. Document any assumptions (like "internet connection required for image generation API", if applicable) and how to set up those APIs (e.g., where to put API keys). Also mention the fully AI-generated nature of the content, as a highlight.

2. **Code Comments and TODOs:** Review the code for any TODO or FIXME comments that haven't been resolved. Either address them or create follow-up tasks (and note them in Future Tasks section). Remove debugging logs or console prints that were added during development, unless they are genuinely useful for future debugging (in which case convert them to proper logging with a debug flag).

3. **Placeholder Removal:** If any placeholder assets or content were used (e.g., a temporary image or dummy text while awaiting generation), replace them now with the AI-driven ones. For instance, if there was a default avatar sprite shown before generation completes, ensure that once generation is done it gets replaced. If any static narrative text was in use for testing, remove it. The final product should only use AI-generated or procedurally generated content, as per the project's core requirement.

4. **Dependency Audit:** Double-check that all new dependencies are correctly listed and no unused dependencies are left. For Python, run `pip freeze` vs `requirements.txt`; for Node, see if any library was added but not used. Remove anything unnecessary to keep the project lean.

5. **Final Code Style Pass:** Run formatters (Black, Prettier) to ensure uniform code style. Lint the project and fix any lingering warnings (e.g., unused variables, etc.). This is just to keep the repository tidy and professional.

**Affected Files:** `README.md` (significant additions), potentially any source files where placeholders or TODOs exist. Maybe update `docker-compose.yml` or env sample files if new env vars were added.

**Validation:** Read through the README as if you are a new developer or user – ensure it's understandable and complete. Build the project from scratch following the README to verify nothing is missing. Check that no placeholder content remains in the running app. At runtime, everything the user sees or interacts with should be dynamically created by the AI logic (validate this by scanning through the code one more time or using search to make sure no static story text or images are left). Once this is done, the feature implementation is considered complete and polished.

---

### [ ] Future Tasks

**Key Items:**

1. **Enhanced Story Generation:** Fine-tune the LLM prompt or parameters to improve the coherence and creativity of generated stories. For example, if some outputs are too long or repetitive, adjust the system prompt or use few-shot examples. This may involve experimenting with the model (llama3-70b) parameters or adding prompt instructions for variation. (This is ongoing R&D to make the AI output even better.)

2. **Additional Mini-Game Types:** Extend the system to support more `miniGame` scene types beyond the obstacle run (e.g., a puzzle mini-game or a turn-based battle). This would require adding new Phaser scenes (and possibly training new RL models for each if needed), updating the SceneDSL schema to include those types, and of course handling them in the DynamicScene flow.

3. **Multi-Prompt Story Arcs:** Allow the game to continue beyond a one-shot story. This could mean taking the epilogue and using it as input for a new prompt to Groq (for a sequel quest), essentially chaining adventures. This would involve frontend UI to ask the user if they want to continue, and managing state between runs.

4. **Deployment and Scaling:** Containerize the AI services for cloud deployment. Ensure the image generation and LLM calls can scale (perhaps by using caching heavily or a queue system for handling many requests). Also possibly integrate a cheaper local model alternative for offline use (if Groq API usage is costly, maybe have a local fallback model). Load testing and optimization would be part of this task to handle many users.

5. **UI/UX Improvements:** Polish the visuals and user experience. For instance, add background music or sound effects for events (could be procedurally generated or CC-licensed). Improve the dialogue presentation (maybe animate text or add typing effect), and add small animations to sprites (like blinking or idle animations, which could be achieved by generating sprite sheets instead of single images in the future). Also, ensure the game is mobile-friendly since it's portrait mode.

*(The above future tasks are not immediate and can be planned for subsequent versions once the core end-to-end functionality is in place.)*

### Relevant Files

**Backend Files:**
- **`backend/app/routers/game.py`** – FastAPI router handling game generation endpoint (`POST /generateGame`). Will be modified to call Groq LLM and trigger image generation.
- **`backend/app/schemas/scene_dsl.py`** – Pydantic models for the SceneDSL JSON structure (e.g., classes for AvatarScene, DialogueScene, etc., if structured). Used to validate and serialize LLM output.
- **`backend/app/services/groq_client.py`** – Module for interacting with the Groq API. Contains API client initialization and functions to send chat completion requests. Key for LLM integration.
- **`backend/app/services/style_transfer.py`** – (Possibly renamed or supplemented by `image_generator.py`) Module to handle image generation or style transfer. Will include calls to external AI image APIs or local model to generate pixel art assets.

**Frontend Files:**
- **`client/src/scenes/Home.ts`** – Phaser scene for the start screen (prompt input). Triggers the generation request and then starts DynamicScene with the received data.
- **`client/src/scenes/DynamicScene.ts`** – Core scene that will dynamically create and manage other scenes (avatar intro, dialogue, mini-game, conclusion) based on the JSON script. Central to making the game flow AI-driven.
- **`client/src/utils/dialogUI.ts`** – Utility for rendering dialogue boxes and choices. Will be used to display NPC lines and present the player's dialogue options during dialogue scenes.
- **`client/src/utils/assetLoader.ts`** – Utility to load assets (tiles, images, sprites). May be extended to load AI-generated assets at runtime. Also contains `loadTemplate(type)` to load scene templates layouts.
- **`client/src/scenes/ObstacleRunScene.ts`** – The mini-game scene (obstacle run) implementation. To be updated to incorporate the RL model for enemy behavior and to accept configuration from the DSL (like obstacle frequency or type based on story twist).

**Asset & Configuration Files:**
- **`client/public/assets/`** – Directory for game assets. After implementing image generation, this will hold the newly generated sprites/backgrounds (e.g., `avatar_<id>.png`, `scene_<id>.png`). Ensure this folder is served and cleaned up as needed (old files might be removed periodically to save space).
- **`client/public/scene_templates/`** – JSON files defining tile maps and object layouts for various scene types. The DynamicScene may load these to provide environment detail (e.g., different backgrounds or obstacle courses). Keep these files in sync with what DynamicScene expects (tile indexes, etc.).
- **`client/public/tfjs_model/`** – The TensorFlow.js model files (for RL agent). Contains `model.json` and weights. Make sure the path is correct and included in the build output.

**Configuration Files:**
- **`.env` / `docker-compose.yml`** – Environment configuration for API keys (Groq API key, any image API key). These need to be set for the app to function (especially Groq), so update these and document their usage.
- **`README.md`** – Project documentation. Will be updated to include the new feature usage and any setup needed. Good to reference for anyone trying to run the project.
- **`.cursor/mcp.json`** – Cursor MCP configuration (if present in project). Ensure the Browser Tools MCP is listed here so the agent can use it. For example, it might contain an entry to run the browser tools server. This allows the AI agent to automatically utilize the MCP during development (for console log reading, etc.).

With these tasks and guidelines, the AI agent (and human developers) have a clear roadmap to implement the "AI LoreCrafter" feature where everything – narrative, visuals, and logic – is AI-generated or controlled, delivering a unique RPG experience. Following the above practices (coding style, using MCPs for debugging, managing dependencies, etc.) will ensure a smooth development process and a maintainable codebase.
